# Huffman Encoding Implementation
This Python script implements Huffman Encoding, a lossless data compression algorithm, which is widely used for text compression and data encoding. The program performs the following tasks:

File Input: The script reads a binary file (englishText.txt in this case), processes the data, and generates the frequency of each byte (symbol).
Building Huffman Tree: Using the symbol frequencies, a binary tree is constructed with the least frequent symbols closer to the leaves and more frequent ones towards the root.
Generating Huffman Codes: A set of unique binary codes (Huffman codes) is generated for each symbol based on its position in the tree.
Output: The script prints the generated Huffman codes for each byte (symbol) along with the average codeword length.
#Features:

Builds the Huffman tree using a priority queue (min-heap) for efficiency.
Outputs the codeword table for each symbol in sorted order.
Calculates and prints the average length of the Huffman codewords.
The program allows you to understand how Huffman coding works by analyzing the frequency of symbols and assigning shorter codes to more frequent symbols. This is a basic and efficient example of data compression.

#Usage:

Modify the file_path variable to use a different text file.
The program will read the file, compute symbol frequencies, build the Huffman tree, generate the codes, and display them along with the average codeword length.
